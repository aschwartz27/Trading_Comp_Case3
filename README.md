## Implementation 1: allocate.py (First place)
The approach used in the competition was a naive risk parody approach. This approach gave heavier weights to funds with lower standard deviations without any consideration on how similar or different the funds were to each other. The purpose of this was to decrease the denominator of the Sharpe ratio to increase the value of the ratio as a whole. There were very small trades between time periods which made the exchange fees negligible. 

## Implementation 2: treeCluster.py (Draft)
This approach was not used on the day of the competition, but a similar approach was determined by the case writers to be the "optimal solution." In testing, allocate.py consistently had a higher Sharpe ratio than this approach. The goal of this approach was to create a binary tree of assets based off their correlations with each other. After the binary tree was created, every sub-tree was given its own weight which eventually gave every fund a weight based an equation used to determine the minimum variance portfolio. Inspiration for this approach came from this website: https://hudsonthames.org/an-introduction-to-the-hierarchical-risk-parity-algorithm/
